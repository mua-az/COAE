## Naive Bayes for Spam Detection

Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Mathematically, it is expressed as:


`P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)`

Where:

- `P(A|B)` is the probability of event `A` occurring, given that `B` is true.
- `P(B|A)` is the probability of event `B` occurring, given that `A` is true.
- `P(A)` is the prior probability of event `A`.
- `P(B)` is the prior probability of event `B`.

In the context of spam detection, `A` can represent the hypothesis that an email is spam (`Spam`), and `B` can represent the observed features of the email (e.g., words, phrases, etc.).


### Applying Bayes' Theorem to Spam Detection

Let's break down how Bayes' Theorem can be applied to determine if an email is spam:

1. `Hypothesis`: We want to determine the probability that an email is spam given its features.
    - `P(Spam|Features)`: Probability that an email is spam given its features.
2. `Likelihood`: This is the probability of observing the features given that the email is spam.
    - `P(Features|Spam)`: Probability of the features appearing in a spam email.
3. `Prior Probability`: The probability that any email is spam, irrespective of its features.
    - `P(Spam)`: Prior probability of an email being spam.
4. `Marginal Likelihood`: The total probability of observing the features, considering both spam and non-spam emails.
    - `P(Features)`: Probability of the features appearing in any email.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can express this as:


`P(Spam|Features) = (P(Features|Spam) * P(Spam)) / P(Features)`




### Example Calculation

Suppose we have an email with features `F1` and `F2`. We want to determine if this email is spam.

- `P(Spam) = 0.3`: Prior probability that any email is spam.
- `P(Not Spam) = 0.7`: Prior probability that any email is not spam.
- `P(F1|Spam) = 0.4`: Probability of feature `F1` given the email is spam.
- `P(F2|Spam) = 0.5`: Probability of feature `F2` given the email is spam.
- `P(F1|Not Spam) = 0.2`: Probability of feature `F1` given the email is not spam.
- `P(F2|Not Spam) = 0.3`: Probability of feature `F2` given the email is not spam.


Using the Naive Bayes assumption:

`P(F1, F2|Spam) = P(F1|Spam) * P(F2|Spam) = 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2 P(F1, F2|Not Spam) = P(F1|Not Spam) * P(F2|Not Spam) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06`

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

`P(Spam|F1, F2) = (P(F1, F2|Spam) * P(Spam)) / P(F1, F2)`

To find `P(F1, F2)`, we use the law of total probability:

`P(F1, F2) = P(F1, F2|Spam) * P(Spam) + P(F1, F2|Not Spam) * P(Not Spam)           = (0.2 * 0.3) + (0.06 * 0.7)          = 0.06 + 0.042          = 0.102`

Thus:

`P(Spam|F1, F2) = (0.2 * 0.3) / 0.102                = 0.06 / 0.102               ≈ 0.588`

Similarly:


`P(Not Spam|F1, F2) = (P(F1, F2|Not Spam) * P(Not Spam)) / P(F1, F2)                    = (0.06 * 0.7) / 0.102                   = 0.042 / 0.102                   ≈ 0.412`

Since `P(Spam|F1, F2) > P(Not Spam|F1, F2)`, the email is classified as spam.
